    <div class="content">
        <p>Effective Date: December 31, 2025</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for using KeyMaster (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. Please read and understand this Privacy Policy carefully before using the App.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The App is a macOS shortcut management tool, primarily helping users manage and use system and application shortcuts. We collect the following types of information:</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Local Data</h3>
        <p>The App only stores data locally on your device, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shortcut package download records</li>
            <li>App settings and preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is completely stored on your device and will not be uploaded to any server.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 System Information</h3>
        <p>To implement the shortcut management functionality, the App needs to access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about currently running applications</li>
            <li>System shortcut configurations</li>
            <li>Keyboard input events (only when the app is active)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is only processed in memory and will not be persistently stored or transmitted.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Permission Requirements</h2>
        <p>The App requires Accessibility permission to read shortcut information from other applications. This permission is only used to implement the core functionality of the app and will not be used for other purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All local data is encrypted and stored</li>
            <li>No personal data is transmitted over the network</li>
            <li>System information is only accessed when necessary</li>
            <li>Follow the principle of minimal permissions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal information with third parties. All data remains on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>5. In-App Purchase and Subscription</h2>
        <p>The App provides subscription services to unlock premium features. Purchase information is processed through Apple's in-app purchase system, and we do not directly access your payment information. During your subscription, you can download all application shortcut packages. After subscription expires, third-party application shortcut packages cannot be downloaded, but already downloaded shortcut packages can continue to be used normally.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Application Shortcut Packages</h2>
        <p>The App integrates application shortcut package functionality. The free version supports shortcuts for macOS built-in and system applications. The paid version allows downloading of all shortcut packages. Shortcut packages are regularly updated and new software support is added. If you need additional software support, please leave a comment on the macOS App Store or send an email to admin@v8en.com.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Updates and Notifications</h2>
        <p>The App may connect to our servers to check for updates, but no personal information will be sent. Update checks only include app version numbers and operating system information.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Major changes will be notified to you through in-app notifications or our website.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please visit our website at <a href="https://v8en.com">https://v8en.com</a> or contact us through the feedback feature within the app.</p>
